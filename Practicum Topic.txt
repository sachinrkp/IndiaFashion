Around 1.3 billion people are living in India and shopping for apparel online is very common these days. 
India has so much diversified Ethnic apparel in its culture which can be categorised using CNN models.

In the lifestyle category, most of the apparel classification models are currently available for Western 
Wear and there are very few classification models for Indian Ethnic apparel. 
So, there is a need for a classification model which targets specifically Indian Ethnic Apparel.

So, this might be an interesting area for study. We plan to add more subcategories to the existing 
IndoFashion dataset with different augmentation techniques and train the pre-existing models along 
with additional attributes like the colours, and tags of the apparel images.
